I'm just this guy, you know?

I mostly post stuff about board games and wargames. I reviews of stuff I've played and write guides on building/painting models. 

Sometimes I post about music. This tends towards heavy/progressive metal but don't hold that against me. A pretty effective segment of my totality can be found in a brain dump of a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4rhyXjREPTKLH7BT1Mr3l3?si=a4cb951e22e446a4). There's more Welsh Male Voice Choirs than you'd expect.

Once in a blue moon I post super specific technical things.

In my 9-5 I am a Software "Engineer" doing .NET stuff in eCommerce. In the past I've also worked with medical devices and manufacturing.

My academic achievements are probably no longer relevant but I did Astrophysics then Computer Vision Engineer at The University of Sheffield.
