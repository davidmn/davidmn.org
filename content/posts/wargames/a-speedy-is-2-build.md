After watching a lot of [Plasmo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC53hZgZPlQmKWFRFSpxbSxw) I decided to build my first historical armoured fighting vehicle. I picked the 1/72 scale IS-2 from Revell, mostly because it's cheap and easy.

The first few stages went very quickly. Some might say too quickly because I applied paint far too early.

You'll notice that I added more grey plastic which I'd have to paint again. Also the tow hook thing on the back is upside down.

The wheels for the tracks are a bit of a pain. The teeth on the cogs are just a awful.

The tracks were a non stretchy single ribbon of links. I test fit them with the intention of taking them off to paint and weather separately. They proved to be such a pain to get on I left them on after the test fit and glued them in place.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2019/12/is2-5.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The tank in a different shade of green</figcaption></figure>
I decided that the tone of the green was a little too blue so I repainted the entire tank in a more yellow green which I think worked really well.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2019/12/is2-6.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Metal tracks and decals applied.</figcaption></figure>
The decals were great fun to apply and softened really well. There were a couple of areas that didn't really work so I painted by hand.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2019/12/is2-7.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Decals finished, chipping and weathering applied.</figcaption></figure>
I did my first real attempt at chipping using acrylics and a cocktail stick. I think they're a little too much but overall I think I achieved some depth. The rust on the turret weld seam was done using oils which I think worked perfectly, especially the contrast with the white stripes.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2019/12/is2-8.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>More chipping and highlights.</figcaption></figure>
I then decided to chip the white paint. I think it worked quite well but in some areas it really shows that the decals are a little thick. I also came in with a yellow oil paint and did some highlighting.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2019/12/is2-9.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Different lighting makes the green look more blue.</figcaption></figure>
The rear of the tank got a similar treatment. Here you can really see that I went overboard with the chipping.

I'm leaving it here for now. I'd like to do a little diorama at some point but I think i could do a better job after learning some lessons on this. The 1/72 scale was fiddly at some point but I think will work nicely for a diorama.

I'm very pleased with the result and will be doing some more AFV in the future.
