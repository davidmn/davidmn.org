A new edition of Warhammer 40,000 is out. To continue the tradition ([8th](/posts/wargames/warhammer-40k-8th-edition) [9th](/posts/wargames/warhammer-9th-edition)) here's a post about it.

Since [WarhammerFest](/posts/wargames/golden-demon-2023) my thoughts have solidified. I just don't care for GW stuff at the moment[0] and that's fine. The models in the Leviathan box look nice but I know I'd never paint them. In fact I've put all my Warhammer in the loft to make space for 15mm Second World War stuff. If you're hyped and enjoying 10th, more power to you. I'm interested to see how the rules refresh plays out. I just don't want to find out for myself ðŸ˜‚.

I've been enjoying a few other things in the wargames sphere recently.

I played a few games of Infinity last month. It's very good. It feels tight despite the large rule book. I built and painted my Haqqislam action pack in no time and I'm looking to expand for some larger games.

I'm also looking forward to [Lard Workshop](https://www.bhgs.org.uk/britcon.html) at Britcon in August.

Happy gaming.
