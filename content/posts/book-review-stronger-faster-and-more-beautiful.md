I read Stronger, Faster, and More Beautiful by Arwen Elys Dayton after reading [Terence Edenâ€™s review of it](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/03/book-review-stronger-faster-and-more-beautiful-arwen-elys-dayton/).

I thought it was fine. Probably a really good intro to this sort of speculative fiction about tinkering with biology with a nice change of perspective for the protagonists.

Glad I've read it but I doubt I'll re-read it. The ultimate fence sitting review. Just holding myself accountable to posting when I've wrangled my brain to pay attention to an entire book.
