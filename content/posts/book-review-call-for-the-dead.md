I had the urge to read some John le Carr√© so I picked up the first book featuring George Smiley. It's actually great. A breezy 170 odd pages. A nice tight mystery that's resolved very well. It's definitely from a different age. At one point Smiley pops into a pub for a whisky and then goes off in his car.

I really appreciate that era of technology for a mystery. There's no need to remove mobile phones arbitrarily. Post cards can become key plot points. It's just very cool.

I've already started the second book.
