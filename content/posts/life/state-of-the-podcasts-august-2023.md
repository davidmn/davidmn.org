Back in 2017 I [wrote](/posts/life/state-of-the-podcast-september-2017) about the podcasts I was listening to. Five years later here's an update. I'm embedded in the Apple ecosystem so now my podcatcher is Apple Podcasts. This year's choice cuts are as follows.

[2 Good Boys](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/2-good-boys/id1065483891) is a classic Friends Chatting podcast.

[AvTalk](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/avtalk-aviation-podcast/id1215571407). I've been listening to this since just before the pandemic. It's all about commercial aviation and is dead interesting.

[Doctor Who: Too Hot For TV](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/doctor-who-too-hot-for-tv/id1501843840) is my top pick for DW podcasts. It's about spin off material, think Big Finish, Books, Comics, etc.

[Enjoy An Album](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/enjoy-an-album-with-liam-withnail-christopher/id1558358559) is about music but is really some friends having very funny chat. A highlight of the podcast release schedule.

[Regular Features](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/regular-features/id457523665) has been on rotation for a decade now. I am a bee.

[The Back Page](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-back-page-a-video-games-podcast/id1542406765) is about video games (and other media) but with more of a magazine style.

[The Social Distant Sports Bar](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-socially-distant-sports-bar/id1503926981) is another bunch of friends chatting. Not about sport as much as you'd expect.

[Two Star Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/two-star-podcast/id898737118) won the podcast war. Another bunch of good lads chatting.
