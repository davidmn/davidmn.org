Some of the albums I have enjoyed in 2021. In no order and not all from 2021.

My GOTY has such a ripping soundtrack. [Barry](https://twitter.com/nostoppingepoch)knocks it out of the park.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/10/image-1.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Oak, Ash &amp; Thorn - Dark Forest</figcaption></figure>
Wow. Just wow. I found these guys via [Sayem](https://twitter.com/SayemAhmd)'s excellent metal [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0tlYZRI5FnNJU4EqF9Lrpr?si=370599f732c6423f). The sound of drinking a pint of warm bitter and shooting a longbow.

Dark, raw, noise. I've done a lot of work to this. I had an In Gallows by Mass shirt that I wore to death and thankfully they put out another great one this year. Unfortunately I missed their gig in Birmingham, next time though!
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/10/image-3.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Butterfly 3000 - King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard</figcaption></figure>
I've been aware of King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard because of their name. This came out and I gave it a spin. It's a good one to put on over breakfast.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/10/image-4.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Grace Under Pressure - Rush</figcaption></figure>
I went on a big Rush binge this year and Grace Under Pressure came out as my favourite. After picking up the bass this year I've been appreciating Geddy Lee even more.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/10/image-5.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Abyss - Unleash the Archers</figcaption></figure>
Abyss came out last year but I listened to it at least once a week. They slap so hard.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/10/image-6.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Liquid Tension Experiment 3 - Liquid Tension Experiment</figcaption></figure>
They're back baby!!!
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/10/image-7.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The Frozen Throne - Kalida</figcaption></figure>
I discovered Kalida this year. They've got some great hooks and great vocals.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/10/image-8.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Feuer &amp; Flamme - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckSEnb_I3Zg">dArtagnan</a></figcaption></figure>
This album hit my Release Radar and I fell in love with the cheesy upbeat folky German vibes. Musketeer Rock.
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2021/12/image.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Fear of a Blank Planet - Porcupine Tree</figcaption></figure>
The last month or two of 2021 was heavily dominated by Porcupine Tree with Fear of a Blank Planet topping the play counts.
