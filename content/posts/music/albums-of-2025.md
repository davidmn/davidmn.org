It's time for the annual tradition where I write about the music I have enjoyed this year. This time around the links are to Qobuz because if you've not hard, Qobuz is having a moment.

I kicked off the year attempting a Queen full-listen. I gave it a fair whack but didn't finish the project. In terms of albums I really enjoyed [Queen I](https://open.qobuz.com/album/mqjr2qd5ri0ec) and [Sheer Heart Attack](https://open.qobuz.com/album/0060252764410). My top two tracks from the experience were [Brighton Rock](https://open.qobuz.com/track/3374742) and [Breakthru](https://open.qobuz.com/track/178468532). I think those two tracks highlighted the range that Queen had.

After I gave up on a Queen full-listen I embarked on, and completed, an Iron Maiden one. I'd heard it all before (ish) but this time I was giving each album multiple plays with active listening. I posted about the experience for months. To summarise I think Blaze Bayley was robbed and The X-Factor is much better than folk give it credit for. The band suffered from a lot of poor production and the wheels fall off after A Matter of Life and Death.
