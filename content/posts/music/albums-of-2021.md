Some of the albums I have enjoyed in 2021. In no order and not all from 2021.

## Thatcher's Techbase OST - Barry "Epoch" Topping

My GOTY has such a ripping soundtrack. [Barry](https://twitter.com/nostoppingepoch) knocks it out of the park.

## Oak, Ash & Thorn - Dark Forest

Wow. Just wow. I found these guys via [Sayem](https://twitter.com/SayemAhmd)'s excellent metal [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0tlYZRI5FnNJU4EqF9Lrpr?si=370599f732c6423f). The sound of drinking a pint of warm bitter and shooting a longbow.

## Ellipsism - Ba'al

Dark, raw, noise. I've done a lot of work to this. I had an In Gallows by Mass shirt that I wore to death and thankfully they put out another great one this year. Unfortunately I missed their gig in Birmingham, next time though!

## Butterfly 3000 - King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard

I've been aware of King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard because of their name. This came out and I gave it a spin. It's a good one to put on over breakfast.

## Grace Under Pressure - Rush

I went on a big Rush binge this year and Grace Under Pressure came out as my favourite. After picking up the bass this year I've been appreciating Geddy Lee even more.

## Abyss - Unleash the Archers

Abyss came out last year but I listened to it at least once a week. They slap so hard.

## Liquid Tension Experiment 3 - Liquid Tension Experiment

They're back baby!!!

## The Frozen Throne - Kalida

![](/content/images/2021/10/image-7.png)

I discovered Kalida this year. They've got some great hooks and great vocals.

## Feuer & Flamme - dArtagnan

![](/content/images/2021/10/image-8.png)

This album hit my Release Radar and I fell in love with the cheesy upbeat folky German vibes. Musketeer Rock.

## Fear of a Blank Planet - Porcupine Tree

The last month or two of 2021 was heavily dominated by Porcupine Tree with Fear of a Blank Planet topping the play counts.
