It's that time again: Dave builds some terrain for speculative wargames games.

I managed to buy a set of Realm of Battle boards, years after they stopped being sold. For less than retail including shipping! Praise be.

In my excitement I spent my lunch break attacking the first 3 panels with primer. Two are already quite thickly painted but I think BioStrip will deal with that.

I'll follow a similar process to the Kill Team board I did a few years ago and post photos as I go. As these are 2x2ft rather than 1.5x1.5ft, I'll be doing them one at a time.

The vague plan is:

- Prime
- Mid/dark earth tone base coat
- Dark earth wash
- Dry brush up to light earth
- Similar for rocky areas but with grey
- Pick out the skulls
- Matte varnish to protect
- Apply turf basically all over
- Selective static grass in corners
- Maybe some shrubs

Hopefully I'll actually get some use out of these, unlike the Kill Team board which never got used, and the half done foam base board I started recently. The RoBB has some advantages:

- Already square
- Lightweight but rigid
- Stackable even with their varying terrain
- Comes with a case for nice storage under a bed

Once they're all done I plan on putting fabric between each board in the case to avoid things rubbing or banging too much. I don't plan on carrying these anywhere but I'd like my work to stand some chance.
