As always, I've listened to a lot of music this year. Some new. Some one. 

My most anticipated release this year was [Ridge and Furrow](https://open.spotify.com/album/5vuTjy8UUXqBSLbtdDGtBR?si=ECXxASRVTJWPV7-yGMqDhg) EP from Dark Forest. DF were are big discovery for me last year and I just love them. The new EP is excellent. I hope they put out a full album again soon.

A blast from the past is Jethro Tull's [Heavy Horses](https://open.spotify.com/album/27EEeQwWctNFwKzbYYB7v4?si=0ufVRYJ6RlamoTC55zc2Kg). Originally release in 1978, I've been listening to the 2003 remaster on Spotify. I listened to [Original Masters](https://open.spotify.com/album/1kjaFSydQR5tWnm5Ph4DyP?si=6rQYko4YS4G4ACEqqu1AyA) growing up but never investigate JT's back catalogue. I heard Acres Wild somewhere which put me onto this cracking album.

Brymir's [Voices in the Sky](https://open.spotify.com/album/3DsEVgN8NGAa0u5LaVhZsx?si=IIJ1EXxHRUi75qcaDgBW1Q) came out this year and featured in [Ba'al's August](https://baalband.co.uk/2022/08/24/monthly-playlist-august-2022/) recommendations. It reminded me how much I enjoy melodic death metal which caused me to revisit a lot of Children of Bodom.

I saw Less Than Jake in April and it was maybe the best gig I've ever been to. So have had all of their hits on repeat. The stand out is [Silver Linings](https://open.spotify.com/album/6PIQdcVGp07UYR4zWhVE1O?si=6sG3F5j9TqS_PFQTUSJBHA) from 2020 which I'll put on and listen to it all while washing up. How very millennial. I think the regular version is better than the deluxe, I have no need for the acoustic covers.

On the ska punk theme, Goldfinger's  [Never Look Back (Deluxe Edition)](https://open.spotify.com/album/6qkETtOzEEXtL3fB4Jdatx?si=VILxv7qRRKmZ8ddFbNCpAQ) has as been on a lot. Lots of bangers. A few I hadn't heard before. Very nice. With this I prefer the Deluxe edition because the extra tracks are great and it gives us Avril Lavigne on [Here In Your Bedroom](https://open.spotify.com/track/0eOKxLySILR9x85cknejae?si=83dfbf91f8b14150).

Sabaton brought out another World War I album. It's alright. I wrote about it at length [here](/posts/sabaton-the-war-to-end-all-wars-review). There are a few bangers on it so it should get a mention.

Nekrogoblikon's 2018 album [Welcome To Bonkers](https://open.spotify.com/album/6EXsfqTqHgc0XNti4Dn5r7?si=EhN2nlc-Sv-bs66q74P8aw) hit me just right with [The Magic Spider](https://open.spotify.com/track/2KysEWFfA9H8zSh91f4m8R?si=9ebcf0e1fe224fc7). I'd been aware of the band since [Gavin](https://twitter.com/GeshGav) mentioned them on an episode of [2 Good Boys](https://twitter.com/2gdbys) years ago but never investigate them. The Magic Spider appeared in my Discover Weekly and I fell in love with the whimsy. I expect it to be pretty high up my most played tracks of 2022.

I watched The Matrix a few times this year because it's great and safe. So I got really into the soundtrack by Don Davis. It's just a banger. Off the back of that I made a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6eFXaBAgPxnMjHOPFujQcK?si=01a84d4df3154895) of film (and TV) scores that I enjoy. It's quite basic but I have to say the first Michael Bay Transformers film has some great tracks.

A shout out again to [Richie Morgan](https://twitter.com/WretchedMorgan)'s playlist [Progressive Values](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4SlCG55PHOn6c0mUF0tyvr?si=a8e2e71e885b4b8d). We listen to it a lot when on long drives. A masterpiece.

This year saw my mega-playlist grow to more than 2000 tracks. It saw a rebrand from YAAAAASSSSS to [Hey dol! Merry dol!](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4rhyXjREPTKLH7BT1Mr3l3?si=3613a75dc24f4531) as I have become increasingly Bombadil-pilled.

Finally, I think it's worth talking about Spotify. I wrote about my time with Apple music earlier this year (on a post which I have yet to revive from the great crash of 2022). Spotify really does fit my usage, the music library is immense, decent apps, no issues getting audio to my car, and the way it surfaces new music to me is really excellent. I don't care for them doing podcasts or audiobooks and the way they treat artists is bad. However there's just so much music I wouldn't have heard without it. So much vinyl and gig tickets I would never have purchased directly from the bands. I think 2023 will be a year where I try to acquire local copies (either physical or DRM free files) of my most beloved music, if Spotify were to go away tomorrow I'd lose a lot of stuff I'd like to have access to. This is a thing I have already been doing with film & TV so it shouldn't be too difficult.
