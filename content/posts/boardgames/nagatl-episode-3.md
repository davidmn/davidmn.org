Fab used the remote kill switch he installed in my PC to prevent me recording episode 3 of Not as Grumpy they Look a few weeks back.
 
We managed to sneak a recording in without Fab noticing and [here](https://notasgrumpyashelooks.wordpress.com/2016/10/27/not-as-grumpy-as-they-look-the-one-where-we-get-distracted/) it is!
 
We chat a lot about LCGs and party games. Then we fawn over some bits of plastic.
