It's coming to the end of the year and I'm reflecting on some predictions I made on [GNR episode 30](http://sixgun.org/episode/gnr30). We'll do a wrap up of it later but I thought I'd write a little bit about my failed experiment 2017x52.
 
I was aiming to post at least one photo on Flickr every week this year. One photo that I liked and was taken that week (roughly).
 
I failed monumentally. In fact I only made it a [few](https://www.flickr.com/photos/147361745@N03/sets/72157674882606833) weeks into 2017.

It wasn't all a waste of time though. It was primarily going to be a project to improve my photography, to try to enjoy it more, and to learn how to use tools. If you measure it by that it's been a great success. I've taken some photos that I really like. I've learnt how to rescue photos with Lightroom.
 
I don't take my camera everywhere and most of my shots are from holidays or events. It has been pointed out that they aren't really a very good document of the events but I think that's good. I don't want to take photos of pretty much identical landscapes when I could be doing some edgy dutch angle low depth of field image of a leaf.

Hopefully I'll continue to improve in 2018. Maybe I'll learn how to do white balance properly not just make everything look a bit warm.
