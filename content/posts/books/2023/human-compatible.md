I’m not optimistic about the future of Artificial Intelligence. This book reinforced that despite a quite optimistic outlook on AI. It describes flaws with current AI and how we might change tack to create beneficial artificial intelligence. Unfortunately I must refer to one of my favourite memes:

![Man playing a card in a card game, and in Spanish, text over the card "The problem is capitalism", text over the man is "me", the table has the text "a casual conversation"](/content/images/2023/08/capital.jpg)

I don’t believe the current incentives for business (maximising shareholder returns) will allow for the paradigm shift that Russel is advocating.

I’d recommend reading it. I hope he’s right and I can change my priors.
