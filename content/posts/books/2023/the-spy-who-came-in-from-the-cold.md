I finished book 3 of the George Smiley series a week or so ago. It's not got a lot of George here and I missed him.

The broad story was enjoyable but is felt like a drag. It takes a while establishing the key spy shit. Then there's a large repetition in an interrogation then trial. 

I had a cheeky peek at the reviews of the next in the series. Might have a little break and have another go at The Culture series.
