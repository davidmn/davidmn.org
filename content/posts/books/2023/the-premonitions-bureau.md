To quote [CMB](https://twitter.com/macarthurboyd) “It’s so sad man”

I am led to believe this is a book about real events. That makes it all the more sad. Having read The Demon Haunted World as a teen it’s obvious that that this would rile me up. 

I’d like to have had a premonition to not bother with it. Why didn't The Bureau let me know, was I not in the (generous) 3% success rate?
