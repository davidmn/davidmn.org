This is another one from Book Club at work. It's 97 short essays/blog posts that cover a wide variety of topics related to The Cloud. It's really hit and miss. There are really specific articles on the nuances of AWS which contrasted with some quite vague articles. Thankfully the titles are very descriptive. The essays on monitoring and alerting are very solid.

I wouldn't not recommend it but I think you should have a flick through the titles to see if anything piques your interest.
