This was an absolute joy to read. I’ve been watching some of Filmdeg Miniatures interviews with various former Games Workshop employees. After one with Mike McVey I knew I had to pick up a copy of this book. 

It was published in 1993 so is as old as me but the advice contained within is still as relevant as ever, just like me. It teaches the house style of GW from the early 90s which has an incredibly vibrant colour palette with a focus on making photos from that era look good on boxes and in magazines. 

I don’t think I learnt anything new as I think all of Steve’s point have diffused into the wargaming world and will have been taught again in White Dwarf or the Lord of the Rings magazine. Hell I think modern YouTubers are recycling the same ideas even today. What was interesting was seeing how many more products are available these days. No painting handles, wet palettes, grass tufts, colour balanced task lamps, or pre prepared basing mixtures. These products might make things easier now but is the end result is still all down to practice.
