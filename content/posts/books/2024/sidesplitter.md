Am I an autobiography guy now? I've read four in the last two years. My previous thirty odd years had a running total of exactly zero.

As a BudPod enjoyer I thought it was only fair to read Phil Wang's book after raving Pierre's. It's a really entertaining read that has very well thought out and explained takes on life. Much like Phil's stand-up this book talks a lot about rac. Here he focuses on his British Malaysian heritage, how his experiences differed in the two countries.  Phil has a wonderful turn of phrase and sense of comedic timing which he brings to bear when touching on some very serious topics.

I heartily recommend Sidesplitter.
