I Kickstarted this back in April 2021, it arrived last month and I've given it a thorough read but haven't made anything from it yet.

A beautiful hardback with that Games Workshop rulebook smell. Utterly fantastic production values. So many incredible photographs of finished terrain and excellent step-by-step ones too.

I'm not sure you can get this any more but I'd recommend it to anyone wanting some inspiration. It really gets back to the core principles of making models from random crap you might put in recycling.
