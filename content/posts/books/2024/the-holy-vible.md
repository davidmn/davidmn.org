2023 was the year I was awoken to Elis James via The Socially Distant Sports Bar podcast. I'm now on my way to become a Retro Oner (listening to all of Elis and John's podcasts).

I have been sharing my Retro Oner journey with a friend and I said "Wouldn't it be great if John Robins had written a book?". Turns out Elis and John already wrote a book and it's good fun. Especially in January 2024 while they're on a short break.

Get the audiobook because it's got a bunch of bonus content.
