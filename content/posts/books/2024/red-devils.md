I have had a copy of Red Devils since its release in 2022. I took a while to start, and a while to finish. That might normally indicate a lack of quality, but just shows my Book Butterfly nature and distractability.

Red Devils by Mark Urban is superb. It follows the founding of the Regiment through to the end of the war (and a little beyond). As I settle into my 30s I am sure you have noticed I love reading history and particularly the Second World War, like some sort of wargaming stereotype. To that I say: fair play, you have got me there. I have read broad histories of events, books focusing on specific campaigns, but I have not read the history of a specific group of individuals like this. Urban follows the regiment in a broad chronological sense but also weaves the stories of a individuals in. The result is informative and page turning. Urban's prose sits well with me and I will be sure to pick up another of his book soon, The Tank War looks to be my jam.

If you are into your WW2 history I am sure you are already aware of this book, but if you missed it you should put it at the top of your reading backlog. You should also give the [War Movie Theatre](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/war-movie-theatre/id1658615966) podcast a listen where Urban has [been a guest](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/war-movie-theatre/id1658615966?i=1000660384094).
