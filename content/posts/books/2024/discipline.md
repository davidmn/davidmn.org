TLDR: skip.

This was on a big list of books someone enjoyed last year. There were some bangers on the list as well as this book. I gave it a go and got half way through. It's a vague intro to Stoicism using the Great man theory, and I never want to hear about Lou Gehrig again. A lot of the Great man examples directly contradict each other which is annoying. If you managed to create a coherent set of routines from this I don't think you'd have any time to do anything else.

If you use classical statues as your avatars on social media, give this book a go, otherwise leave it.
