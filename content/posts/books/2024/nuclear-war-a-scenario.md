You can't look away from this page turning book which imagines one way a nuclear war could play out.

I devoured it in two sittings. This future is so bleak you just can't look away. My only complaint is with the writing style. I can live with the short punchy sentences, but I can do without the long lists of details that seem to go on and on without adding value. The descriptions of fires and detonations are also excessive. I get it, nuclear war is bad, now please get back to the discussions of strategy and cold logic.

Get it.
