Has it really been a month since I finished a book? Not good form. Not good.

I finished the breezy Keith Brymer Jones autobiography yesterday. I knew a little about the star of the Pottery Throwdown but his life before going global was totally new to me. If you're at all interested in pottery I think this is a must read.

I've done a little bit of throwing recently and this book makes me want to do a lot more.
