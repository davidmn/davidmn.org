I read this as part of a book exchange with my partner.

I’ve tried writing about my thoughts and feelings but it’s all been a more verbose way of saying “it’s fine”. It’s fine, I don’t regret my time with it but I won’t be revisiting it. I think the blurb is the perfect way for you to decide if it’s for you.
