A good follow up to [Nuclear War](/posts/books/2024/nuclear-war-a-scenario). It's a bleak read in a subtly different way to Nuclear War. It's also very long and some might say rambling but I think the tangents about various people's histories. If you did GCSE history in the 00s it fills in a lot of gaps between and around SALT and START. Unlike Nuclear war I had to put this book down a lot, it really did take a month or so to get through the 600-odd pages.

Probably the last book I'll finish in 2024. That brings the total (that I posted here) to 22. More on that in the end of year wrap up.
