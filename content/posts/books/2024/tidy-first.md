I'm a big Kent Beck fan. Big fan of Extreme Programming ideas. Tidy First is his latest book and I wish it was around when I started working on software.

Kent details some tidyings (refactorings) and then talks about when to use them. He discusses the tension between delivering changes vs having options for change in the future. There's a really nice aside on coupling and how it only makes sense with respect to changing the code. Coupling is fine if you don't need to change stuff.

It's a breezy read at 99 pages, absolutely pick this up. I'm ready for the rest of the series.
