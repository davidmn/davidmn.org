It's been a while. I've been reading but not finishing anything. With the release of Dune Part 2 I picked up Dune again for a rare seconding reading. I finished it on a 4 hour train back from Glasgow.

Dune is flawed but I love it. There's not a lot to say that hasn't been said over the last 59 years. It's very prog rock and waistcoat coded. I started Dune Messiah moments after finishing it.
