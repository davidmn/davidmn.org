What a vibe!!! You might have noticed I’m on a big nostalgia kick at the moment. Part of that has been finally looking into Warhammer Fantasy. Not the Old World that launched recently but the real Old World published in 2000. So specifically 6th edition. Why? Well from some conversations I’m led to believe it’s a golden era for Warhammer Fantasy. Plus all that Blancheian goodness from that time. 

I’ve never given Fantasy the time of day, thinking it’s some weirded up Tolkien nonsense. 
After reading the rulebook cover to cover I think I finally understand the appeal, it is weirded up Tolkien but that’s actually good. Safe to say I’ve fallen head over heels for the setting. I’m almost tempted to pick up some Black Library books set in the world. Almost. 

What about the system? Well I’ve not played it yet but it looks fantastic and I can see why it’s held in such high esteem. The designers notes suggest this edition was an attempt to clean up the system rather than innovate and that comes through. I can see how Fantasy was adapted into a historical game now. 

As for the High Elves, I’ve already got a few metal lads but I’m ready to dive in with a full High Elves army. The army book is pretty simple but still beautiful. I can’t wait to shunt around blocks of spearmen who fight in three ranks. Maybe get a lad on a big dragon?
