We recently went on holiday to Scotland and I managed to finish three books that have been in progress for a while.

Crab and Bee’s Matter of Britain, by Helen Billinghurst and Phil Smith. Not entirely sure what this is. I got it through a [Dan Sumption](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dansumption/crab-and-bees-matter-of-britain/) kick starter, which describes it as

> An anarchic retelling of the folk tales of Albion, by noted artists and mythogeographers Crab & Bee. A banishing spell for nostalgia!

Which is a very good description. Like nothing I've ever read before and I'll need to give it another pass some day. I recommend it, I think.

Second up is This Golden Fleece: A Journey Through Britain’s Knitted History by Esther Rutter. Ele gave me selected chapters to read on this. A history of a very niche thing is exactly in my wheelhouse and this is a banger of a book.

Wales: England’s Colony? by Martin Johnes. I think this was an Elis James recommendation and it's pretty good. I haven't seen the accompanying TV series but the arguments made are very reasonable and as he gets into the 20th century it aligns with my family history and my experience very neatly. I really enjoyed Johnes style and the opening few pages should be a must read for all of those English people, you know the ones. Yet another book that pairs well with Unruly.
