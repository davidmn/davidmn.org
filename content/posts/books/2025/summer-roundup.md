I finished a couple of books over the summer.

## Queens of the Abyss: Lost Stories From The Women Of The Weird

A lovely collection of sixteen horror stories from women authors from the 19th and early 20th century. There's a little forward before each story from the editor. Published by the British Library under their Tales of the Weird line. It's very out of my wheelhouse but I loved it and recommend it without reservation.

## Project Hail Mary

I have had this recommended to me by so many people since its release in 2021. It sure is an Andy Weir book. Weir has a very readable style which creates a real page turner, I finished it in a couple of sittings. Sounds great right? The problem is the cloying aftertaste of I Fucking Love Science (a Facebook page that I found very annoying when I was at universe). Remember the "This is the power of math, people" in Star Trek? It's like that. 

"What about the Bobiverse? You enjoyed that didn't you" I hear you cry. Well yeah. They're both in the same vibe-space but I the Bobiverse is much closer to a comedy which nicely balances the earnest ideas. PHM doesn't have that balance for me.

I didn't entirely dislike the book. The premise of the sun dimming is a cool device, the unsubtle dig at patent trolls and IP law was cathartic, and Weir writes some really touching moments along the way.

## Solitary Confinement

This was a Ted Gioia recommendation. An account written by Christopher Burney, a British spy, about his solitary confinement in WW2 after being captured in occupied France. I haven't finished it yet but I'm not sure when I will. It's a tough and deep read that I'm not "enjoying" but am finding interesting. He's recounting his experience where he thinks deeply about life and philosophy to stave off boredom and madness.
