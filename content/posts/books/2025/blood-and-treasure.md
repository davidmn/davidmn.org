A cracking book that takes you on the a whistle stop tour of conflict over the last millennium, looking at it through an economic lens. Duncan Weldon explains the economic conflict really well, such that a total novice such as myself can follow with ease. Duncan also gets a few well aimed jabs in at economists.

I recommend it but be warned every chapter is going to have to adding new topics to your To Read list.
