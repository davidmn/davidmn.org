Another series where the main guy is called Bob, works in IT, and is thrust into a new sci-fi situation? What are the chances. Turns out like The Laundry Files, I really enjoy the Bobiverse.

I've had friends recommend this series to me for close to a decade and I don't know what put me off for so long. The cover and premise probably felt a little too zany? Appealing too much to nerd culture? I don't know. Either way it's a breezy laugh and I finished it the other.

Bob is a software engineer who gets his head frozen after he dies. He wakes up 100 years later after his brain has been uploaded to a computer and he's being trained to be the mind of a von Neumann probes. The plot then zooms off with lots of juicy Michio Kaku-esque tech.

My one complaint is the end isn't an end in any real sense. Clearly leads into the sequel. I can't complain too much because I've already started that.
