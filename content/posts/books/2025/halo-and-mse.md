Two books to report this time. First is Halo: The Flood which is the second book to be published in the Halo Extended Universe. It's a retelling of the events of Halo and oh boy it is sure a retelling of the events of Halo. This was a real struggle to finish. It's like a someone in another room describing what's happening in the game. You can skip this one but I didn't.

Next up is Modern Software Engineering: Doing What Works to Build Better Software Faster by Dave Farley. Read this for the work book club. We've read an awful lot of similar books so I dare say there were no new ideas here. If you've seen much of Dave's work on YouTube in the last few years you'll have got the core of the message. That being said, if you're new to developing software then there is a lot of good stuff here.

I've started the next book in the Halo series. Not sure what the next non fiction will be.
