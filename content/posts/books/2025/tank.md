If you pre-ordered a hardback about 10 tanks you're going to love it and that's exactly what happened with Mark Urban's latest book.

Urban has written a superb whistle stop tour of tank history. I've watched documentaries about most of the machines covered but there was still loads more in here for me. He also answers the question "are tanks dead yet?" very well.

If you're at all interested in military history I'd say this is a must read.
