I bought a lot of Halo extended universe books for very cheap. The first in the series is The Fall of Reach which is a prequel to the first Halo game. It's a fun military sci fi romp and I enjoyed it a lot. Much like Warhammer fiction, all of the interesting stuff happens away from the battlefield.

I think I've got the first 10 books (in publication order) which may way make the blog very very boring. I'm halfway through book 2, The Flood, which is a bland novelisation of the first game. I'm going to finish it though.
