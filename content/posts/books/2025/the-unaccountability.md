Stafford Beer is a very interesting guy and the and once you learn about the Viable System Model you start to see it (and aspects of it) everywhere. 

The Unaccountability Machine goes on a lovely long dive into Stafford Beer with the rest on the way the world is broken at the moment. There's a lot here that aligns with my experience, reading, and general vibes. I enjoy Dan Davies' writing style which meant even the very dry stuff on the VSM flew by. I'd recommend giving it a go.
