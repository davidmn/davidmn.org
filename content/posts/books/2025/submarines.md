Man I love learning about submarines. They're terrifying bits of kit and I couldn't and wouldn't get on one. A friend recommended Blind Man's Bluff and I devoured it in a few days. It's full of anonymous tales from the USA's submarine spying programme during The Cold war. I'm pretty sure I've watched documentaries about most of the stuff here but I think there are new-to-me details that are anecdotal which didn't make it into the docs, but such is a book on secret submarines publish in the 90s. It meshes really nicely with Command and Control from last year but is more chest beating and jingoistic. Tom Clancy fans would love this book entirely unironically.
