# Conclave 

I've seen the film twice and now read the book and all instances have felt oddly cosy and chill. The ramifications of the decision is objectively huge but when you're in the cloistered space it feels quite small.

The film changes a few things but I'm very happy with the adaption. The film trims some of the Papal admin but I'm kinda here for it. The repetition of the voting procedures create a good rhythm. 

Not that my recommendation means anything on this cultural phenomenon but I would recommend it.

# Our Wives Under the Sea

Spoilers ahead. Someone goes underwater and comes back changed merged with a relationship falling apart. I was sold on the submarine and horror vibes but the relationship and inner monologues. This lead me to expect the "comes back changed" theme to have more oomph.

I probably wouldn't recommend it but you should have a look at the cover which is a total banger.
