What can I say? It's great.

This is my first re-read of LotR in quite a while. I think in at least a decade. I have always been nostalgic for the time I spent with my gran reading LotR and that's only getting stronger. Reading it is like being in a cozy duvet. The prose is verbose, 'old fashioned' and a fatherly. I wouldn't put up with it in a modern book but I will for something so genre defining, so Dave defining.

Onto The Two Towers while trying my hardest to finish up the stragglers from 2024.
