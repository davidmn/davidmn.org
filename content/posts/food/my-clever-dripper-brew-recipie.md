I've bought a Clever Dripper and put the Aeropress and cafetière in the loft. Whilst the Clever can't do the volumes a large cafetière can, it makes great coffee with no sludge and easy clean-up (that's compostable).

The brew method for two cups is:

1. Fold the edges of your unbleached size 4 filter and put it in the Clever Dripper
2. Rinse out the filter with warm water from the tap
3. Grind 20g of beans to a little finer than a cafetière grind and boil your water
4. Add 300g of water to the Clever Dripper, careful here because that's very full
5. Add coffee to water, do not stir
6. Add 200g of water, it'll be very full
7. Leave for 5min as the coffee grounds create a crust
8. Stir the crust in
9. Leave for 5min
10. Draw down into a carafe/thermos
