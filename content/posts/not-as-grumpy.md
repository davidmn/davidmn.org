My good friend [Icarus](https://twitter.com/BenIcarusCotton) has started a podcast! A spin-off if you will, from his blog [Not as Grumpy as He Looks](https://notasgrumpyashelooks.wordpress.com/).
 
More importantly, I'm on the first episode! We talk about board games, randomised combat mechanics, I attempt to talk about EVE after a couple of glasses of wine and, we discuss how perfect the latest Sabaton album is. You can find it over at [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-778862762/not-as-grumpy-as-the-look-pilot-the-whiskey-incident).
