Rather than resolutions, here are my aims for 2023:

1. Paint more miniatures. I had a very good summer of painting miniatures but flagged in the final third of 2022.

2. Play more games with said painted miniatures. I'll be giving a local club a go soon which should hopefully make this one easy.

3. Read more. It's not difficult to read more than me. In 2023 I'd like to find a way around my inability to read at home.

4. Be healthier. I made some good progress in 2022 but COVID and similar bouts of illness messed with the good habits. 

5. Scroll less. Social media is my goto activity and I should focus that energy on the above.

Hopefully this'll hold me accountable.
