Superuser on the Discord has requested I participate in this meme/chain letter. Superuser's is [here](https://kitsu.io/posts/8864173). The idea is that you pick the Game of the Year for every year you've been around.
 
Mine are as follows:
 
1993: Probably crying  
 1994: Same as last year  
 1995: Sand pit  
 1996: Drawing things  
 1997: Still probably drawing things  
 1998: Pretty sure I was building stuff using Lego  
 1999: Jane's USAF (games were discovered in 1999)  
 2000: The Sims  
 2001: Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game (Dave discovers miniatures)  
 2002: Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  
 2003: Need for Speed: Underground  
 2004: The Sims 2  
 2005: Civilization IV  
 2006: Half Life 2: Episode One  
 2007: Team Fortress 2  
 2008: Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots  
 2009: Assassin's Creed II  
 2010: Civilization V  
 2011: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim  
 2012: Warhammer 40k 6th Edition  
 2013: Grand Theft Auto V  
 2014: Mario Kart 8  
 2015: Rocket League  
 2016: Stardew Valley  
 2017: Warhammer 40k 8th Edition
 
Some obvious takes and some lukewarm takes. Enjoy.
